PROJECT LAYOUT

In order to comply with the FTC competition rules, the LEGO NXT is the "brain" of our system. Due to its
nature as an educational toy, we are "supplementing" it with the Raspberry Pi. In plain english, the Pi
will be acting as a master device, communicating commands to the NXT, which then relays the commands to
the rest of the robot. Thus, the NXT remains the center of the layout, fulfilling the rules, and the Pi
is the true powerhouse.
