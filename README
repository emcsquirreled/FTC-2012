This project contains all of the code for FTC Team 4508's 2012-2013 season. Our objective this season
is to push the limits of the FTC program, both technically and socially. Please poke around our code,
hopefully you might learn something. Perhaps you can even teach us something in return!

PROJECT LAYOUT

In order to comply with the FTC competition rules, the LEGO NXT is the "brain" of our system. Due to its
nature as an educational toy, we are "supplementing" it with the Raspberry Pi. In plain english, the Pi
will be acting as a master device, communicating commands to the NXT, which then relays the commands to
the rest of the robot. Thus, the NXT remains the center of the layout, fulfilling the rules, and the Pi
is the true powerhouse.
